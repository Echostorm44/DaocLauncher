This is a game launcher and hotkey runner for the MMO Dark Age of Camelot

I'm writing this because existing launchers I've seen are either closed source, paywalled or are using libs I can't decompile and of course it's better to have it all in C#.

Currently the launcher can launch and rename game instance windows and kill the mutex the game uses to prevent playing more than 2 accounts at once.
